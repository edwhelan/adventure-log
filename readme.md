###Thoughts/Build Process

I decided I wanted to learn and deploy something on the MERN stack and so I did! This is one of my first exposures to MongoDB and thus I kept it simple. A basic CRUD application to allow users to create and delete items to a live database hosted on mLab. Additionally I wanted to get more practice in with React and to make it more complex used Redux as well. I had used Bootstrap before but never inside of a React project so this seemed like a perfect time to explore that as well. It offered some great touches that may have taken me a longer amount of time to implement myself.

### Future Plans
No future plans for this specific deploy, however I do plan to build on this idea with a more complex inventory management system with Characters that can have items assigned to them.
